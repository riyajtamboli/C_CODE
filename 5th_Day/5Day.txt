Problem Statement

Write a C program to find the maximum of three numbers entered by the user.
You must use the nested ternary operator (?:) for the calculation.

Requirements
The program should:

> Accept three integers as input.
> Use the nested ternary operator to determine the largest number.
> Display the maximum number as output.

Restrictions:
_____________________________________
|- Do not use if, else, switch, or loops.
|- Only the ternary operator (?:) should be used for comparison logic.

Input Format
______________
|- Enter three integers separated by spaces.

Output Format
________________
Print the largest number in the format:

Maximum = <value>

Sample Test Cases

Input:
10 20 15

Output:
Maximum = 20

✅ Test Case 2

Input:
-5 -10 -2

Output:
Maximum = -2

✅ Test Case 3

Input:
100 50 200

Output:
Maximum = 200

✅ Test Case 4

Input:
25 25 10

Output:
Maximum = 25

📘 Programming Question
Problem Statement

Write a C program to design a simple calculator that evaluates an arithmetic expression entered by the user in the form:
a op b


Where:

a and b are integers.
op is an operator (+, -, *, /).
The program should use only the ternary operator (?:) to perform operation selection.

Requirements
________________
Accept input as:

number operator number


Example: 10 + 20

Perform the operation based on the operator:

+ → Addition

- → Subtraction

* → Multiplication

/ → Division (integer division)

Validation:

If division by zero occurs, print:

Division by zero not allowed


If an invalid operator is entered, print:

Invalid operator


Restrictions:

Use only ternary operators (?:).

Do not use if, else, switch, or loops.

Input Format

A single expression in the form:

a op b


(with spaces between numbers and operator).

Output Format

Display the result of the expression, or an error message for invalid inputs.

Sample Test Cases
✅ Test Case 1

Input:

10 + 20


Output:

Result = 30

✅ Test Case 2

Input:

15 - 8


Output:

Result = 7

✅ Test Case 3

Input:

12 * 4


Output:

Result = 48

✅ Test Case 4

Input:

40 / 5


Output:

Result = 8

✅ Test Case 5 (Division by Zero)

Input:

50 / 0


Output:

Division by zero not allowed

✅ Test Case 6 (Invalid Operator)

Input:

25 % 4


Output:

Invalid operator

📘 Programming Question
Problem Statement

Write a C program to calculate the electricity bill based on the following rules:

Units Consumed	Rate per Unit
0 – 100	₹1.5
101 – 300	₹2.0
> 300	₹3.0

The user will input the number of units consumed.

The program should calculate the total bill using only nested ternary operators.

Do not use if, else, switch, or loops.

Input Format

An integer value representing the number of units consumed.

Output Format

Display the bill amount in the format:

Bill = <amount>

Constraints

Units consumed ≥ 0

Use only ternary operators (?:) for decision-making.

Sample Test Cases
✅ Test Case 1

Input:

50


Output:

Bill = 75.00

✅ Test Case 2

Input:

120


Output:

Bill = 210.00

✅ Test Case 3

Input:

300


Output:

Bill = 550.00

✅ Test Case 4

Input:

450


Output:

Bill = 1000.00

Programming Question
Problem Statement

Write a C program to calculate Simple Interest (SI) or Compound Interest (CI) based on user choice.

The user will input:

Principal amount (P)

Rate of Interest (R in %)

Time (T in years)

A character choice → S for Simple Interest, C for Compound Interest

The program should use only the ternary operator (?:) to decide which formula to apply.

Formulas:

Simple Interest:

𝑆𝐼=𝑃×𝑅×𝑇/100

Compound Interest:

𝐶𝐼=𝑃×((1+𝑅/100)𝑇−1)

If the user enters any other character, display "Invalid choice".

Input Format
Principal Rate Time Choice

Output Format

If Choice = S → print Simple Interest = <value>

If Choice = C → print Compound Interest = <value>

Otherwise → print Invalid choice

Constraints

Principal > 0

Rate > 0

Time > 0

Choice must be either S/s or C/c

Sample Test Cases
✅ Test Case 1

Input:

1000 5 2 S


Output:

Simple Interest = 100.00

✅ Test Case 2

Input:

1000 5 2 C


Output:

Compound Interest = 102.50

✅ Test Case 3

Input:

2000 10 3 s


Output:

Simple Interest = 600.00

✅ Test Case 4

Input:

1500 8 2 X


Output:

Invalid choice
